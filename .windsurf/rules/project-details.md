We are building a modern agency website called “Arka Labs”, a professional software and AI development studio that helps clients turn their ideas into AI-powered SaaS MVPs in ≤ 21 days, ready for market launch and validation.

The agency offers two main services: 1. MVP Development ($2,600 one-time) — Building complete SaaS MVPs with landing page, authentication, security, database, SEO setup, AI integrations, 2–3 features, analytics, and live deployment on the client’s domain — fully go-to-market ready. 2. Monthly Retainer ($1,500/month) — Ongoing partnership for scaling MVPs into full-grade production SaaS products or developing multiple AI-agentic/internal tools with continuous engineering support, maintenance, and new feature builds.

The website must have a beautiful, modern UI (based on the CRM SaaS Dribbble reference) with soft gradients, clean layout, and minimal design.
Main CTA: “Book a Call” in the navbar and throughout the site.
Core goal: Convert visitors into clients who want fast, AI-powered software product development.

No authentication or user accounts are needed for now — it’s a marketing and conversion website for the agency.
